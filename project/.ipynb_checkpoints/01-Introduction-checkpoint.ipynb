    "Today, review sites such as Yelp and Google play a huge role in the restaurant industry. Consumers are constantly on their devices searching for the next place to eat while simultaneously reviewing the place they just ate at. What is it that makes a consumer satisfied by a restaurant experience? What can a restaurant do to improve their ratings given to them by their customers? This project will explore the reasons why consumers rate restaurants the way they do. In fact, this project will attempt to accurately predict what a consumer will rate a restaurant before they even eat there."

    "The goal of this project is to analyze the dataset via statistical modeling and machine learning to determine if the data from a consumer profile is sufficient enough to determine the consumer's rating of a specific restaurant. If a restaurant is able to know how much a consumer will like their restaurant before they even enter it, they will then know what they need to improve on to better their customer satisfaction."
